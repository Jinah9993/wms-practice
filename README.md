practice

current:
- data : postgreSQL (local) Order, Note
- orders page:
  add order, delete order, update status, search
  orders [id] - can see note(s), add note
- product page:
  sorting (mock data)

things to do:
- create Product data
- add sorting feature to orders page, move delete and update feature to orders [id]
- same format for every page (like orders page: crud, sorting, search, etc..)
- refactoring search as a separate component
